# Maintenance

This guide is for maintainers reviewing pull requests, publishing releases, and keeping the action predictable over time.

## Operating Loop

Use these checks by default:

| Situation | Required check |
| --- | --- |
| Normal pull request | `npm run ci` |
| Report text, scoring, labels, or summaries changed | `npm run ci` and `npm run demo` |
| Runtime source changed | `npm run bundle`, then `npm run ci` |
| Orchestration, rule matching, or GitHub API behavior changed | `npm run check`, `npm run coverage`, and targeted tests |
| Rule behavior or prompt boundary changed | `npm run evaluate` and targeted tests |
| Optional AI prompt behavior changed | `npm run evaluate` and explicit `npm run evaluate:ai` when an API key is available |
| Package contents changed | `npm pack --dry-run` |
| Marketplace readiness | `npm run market:check` |
| Release candidate | `npm run release:check` |

`npm run ci` runs the TypeScript build, test suite, deterministic evaluation fixtures, and bundled `dist/` verification.
`npm run release:check` adds coverage thresholds, the demo run, bundled `dist/` verification, and moderate-severity dependency audit.
`npm run market:check` runs the full local market-readiness gate: CI, coverage, demo, audit, package dry-run contents, and required launch docs.
`npm run evaluate` runs deterministic product fixtures without calling OpenAI.
`npm run evaluate:ai` is an explicit live OpenAI smoke test and is not part of CI.
`npm run bundle` updates the committed action bundle after runtime source changes.

## Test And Coverage Boundaries

`npm run coverage` explicitly includes `src/**/*.ts` and excludes only `src/index.ts` and `src/types.ts`.

Keep `src/index.ts` as a thin GitHub Action process entry point. If new parsing, output, summary, or best-effort write behavior is needed, put the testable logic in `src/action-runtime.ts` or the relevant domain module, then cover it with focused tests. Do not lower coverage thresholds to make a release pass; add tests or remove dead branches.

## Pull Request Review

Check these before merging:

- The change matches Maintainer Firewall's maintainer-first product principles.
- New or changed behavior has focused tests.
- Runtime source changes include the bundled `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.js.map`.
- Public inputs, outputs, finding IDs, report JSON shape, examples, README tables, and docs are updated together.
- Effective-config output remains redacted and does not expose configured secret regex source.
- Best-effort failures are recorded through runtime diagnostics instead of only appearing in logs.
- Secret-like values remain redacted in comments, summaries, annotations, outputs, and JSON reports.

Use the PR template to keep these checks visible during review.

## Release Checklist

Before tagging:

1. Confirm `main` is clean and the latest Test, Release, and CodeQL runs are green.
2. Update `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, README release commands, examples, and docs that mention the release tag.
3. Run `npm run release:check`.
4. Create the tag, for example `git tag v0.7.1`.
5. Push `main` and the tag together.
6. Confirm the GitHub release exists and is not a draft.
7. Confirm the tag-triggered Release workflow and the push-triggered Test and CodeQL workflows all complete successfully.
8. Confirm the release includes the packed `.tgz` asset, the `.sigstore.json` bundle asset, and a GitHub artifact attestation for that asset.

If release automation fails, fix the underlying issue and rerun from the same tag only when the release artifact is still correct. Prefer a new patch tag when the published release content changed.

To verify a downloaded release asset:

```bash
gh attestation verify maintainer-firewall-<version>.tgz -R wangjiehu/maintainer-firewall
```

## Dependency Maintenance

Dependabot groups npm tooling and GitHub Actions updates weekly.

For dependency PRs:

- Run `npm run ci`.
- Run `npm run release:check` when the update touches build, bundle, test, release, or GitHub Actions tooling.
- Run `npm run bundle` and inspect bundled `dist/` changes when runtime dependencies change.
- Keep action version bumps and generated lockfile changes in the same PR.

## Diagnostic Maintenance

Configuration diagnostics cover invalid or surprising config values.
Runtime diagnostics cover best-effort operations that can fail while deterministic triage still completes.

When adding a new best-effort warning path:

- Route the message through the runtime warning sink when the action entry point can observe it.
- Redact configured secret patterns before exposing the message.
- Surface the warning in outputs, step summaries, and JSON reports.
- Add or update tests that prove the warning is captured and redacted.

When adding a protected finding ID, update the central finding ID list so policy, diagnostics, and setup summaries stay aligned.

## Documentation Drift

Documentation is part of the product surface. Update docs in the same PR when changing:

- Action inputs or outputs.
- Finding IDs, severities, labels, or rule policy behavior.
- JSON report shape.
- Step summary content.
- Release commands or workflow examples.
- Rollout, troubleshooting, or maintenance guidance.

The docs tests intentionally check key links and current release tags. Add similar tests when a new doc becomes part of the maintenance workflow.
