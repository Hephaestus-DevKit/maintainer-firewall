**Maintainer Firewall** is a GitHub Action designed for open-source maintainers who want a calmer, high-signal triage queue. It reviews incoming issues and pull requests for evidence, reproducibility, scope, test coverage, and project-specific contribution guidelines.

> [!NOTE]
> **What this is NOT**: This is not an "AI detector." It doesn't try to guess if a human or a machine wrote a contribution. Instead, it asks the only question maintainers actually care about: **Is this contribution actionable, complete, and maintainable?**

## ✨ Core Features

*   🔍 **Evidence-Based Filtering**: Analyzes issue bodies for completeness, environmental context, and minimal reproduction steps.
*   🚦 **Pull Request Inspection**: Checks descriptions, linked issues, size/scope, and test coverage of modifications.
*   🤖 **Context-Aware AI Review (Optional)**: Employs OpenAI to assess contributions against your project's specific guidance (loaded from `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue/PR templates).
*   🛡️ **Security Redaction & ReDoS Safety**: Automatically redacts environment secrets/credentials before processing and shields itself from ReDoS vectors.
*   📊 **Robust Diagnostics**: Emits detailed configuration and runtime diagnostics as Action outputs, step summaries, and JSON reports.
*   🚦 **CODEOWNERS Routing**: Generates routing hints based on CODEOWNERS mapping for quick assignment triage.

## 📈 Rollout Modes

Introduce Maintainer Firewall gradually to build trust and avoid disrupting contributors.

| Mode | Event | Permissions | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Audit** | `pull_request` | `contents: read`, `issues: read`, `pull-requests: read` | Read-only. Outputs results purely to Actions step summaries. No comments/labels. |
| **Advisory** | `pull_request_target` | `contents: read`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write` | Low noise. Comments only when actionable improvements are found. |
| **Collaborative** | `pull_request_target` | `contents: read`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write` | Full engagement. Automatically applies triage labels and writes feedback comments. |
| **Strict** | `pull_request_target` | `contents: read`, `issues: write`, `pull-requests: write` | Gatekeeping. Fails the workflow run when findings do not meet quality thresholds. |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Create the Workflow File

Create a file named `.github/workflows/maintainer-firewall.yml` with the following configuration to start in **Audit Mode** (safe, read-only):

```yaml
name: Maintainer Firewall

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, reopened]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: read
  pull-requests: read

concurrency:
  group: maintainer-firewall-${{ github.event.issue.number || github.event.pull_request.number || github.run_id }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  firewall:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Maintainer Firewall
        uses: Hephaestus-DevKit/maintainer-firewall@v0.7.1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          dry-run: true
```

### Step 2: Add Configuration File (Optional)

Add a `.maintainer-firewall.yml` to the root of your repository to override defaults, suppress specific checks, or enable AI:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hephaestus-DevKit/maintainer-firewall/main/schema/maintainer-firewall.schema.json
version: 1

rules:
  severityOverrides:
    issue-reproduction-missing: warning
    pr-tests-missing: warning

comment:
  enabled: true
  postWhen: findings  # Only comment when improvements are needed

labeling:
  enabled: false      # Enable when ready to auto-label issues/PRs
```
