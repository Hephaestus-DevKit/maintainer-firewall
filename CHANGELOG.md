# Changelog

All notable changes to Maintainer Firewall will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.8 - AI Output Guardrails

- Normalizes AI finding text by compacting whitespace before reports, summaries, and JSON output use it.
- Caps AI finding ids, titles, details, and suggestions so model output cannot produce oversized comments or reports.
- Adds AI response normalization tests for long multiline findings and malformed findings.

## 0.1.7 - Runtime Resilience

- Continues pull request triage with title and body checks when GitHub cannot list changed files, instead of failing the entire action.
- Handles concurrent managed-label creation races by continuing when GitHub reports the label already exists.
- Adds GitHub client tests for pull request file-list fallback, changed-file mapping, and concurrent label creation.

## 0.1.6 - Action Metadata Guidance

- Clarifies Marketplace-facing action input descriptions for dry-run behavior, advisory failures, summaries, and JSON reports.
- Adds a README inputs table so workflow authors can scan every supported input without opening `action.yml`.
- Adds action metadata tests that keep declared inputs, outputs, defaults, and README tables aligned.

## 0.1.5 - Schema Guidance

- Adds descriptions, defaults, examples, and enum guidance to the YAML configuration schema so editors can explain settings inline.
- Adds schema coverage tests that compare documented defaults against the runtime default configuration.
- Clarifies that array settings replace defaults rather than appending to them, and expands README examples to avoid accidental narrowing.
- Lets the repository dogfood current default security patterns instead of pinning an older partial pattern list.

## 0.1.4 - Contributor-Friendly Reports

- Rewrites prominent next steps to speak directly and respectfully to contributors instead of describing them in third person.
- Updates deterministic finding suggestions and the details table heading to use contributor-friendly next-step language.
- Keeps maintainer-only routing guidance explicit for security-sensitive or ownership-sensitive findings.
- Adds workflow warnings for invalid `comment.postWhen` values and below-minimum numeric settings before normalization falls back to safe values.

## 0.1.3 - Skip State Cleanup

- Refreshes an existing Maintainer Firewall report when an ignore rule starts skipping a subject, avoiding stale contributor instructions.
- Removes stale managed labels when a skipped subject still has labels from an earlier run.
- Keeps the default skip path low-noise by updating existing reports instead of creating new skip comments.

## 0.1.2 - Config Robustness

- Makes YAML config merging shape-aware so invalid object, array, boolean, number, or string overrides fall back to defaults instead of crashing the action.
- Ignores unknown config keys during runtime normalization to keep loaded configuration predictable.
- Emits workflow warnings for unsupported config keys and invalid value shapes.

## 0.1.1 - Experience Polish

- Updates existing clean reports so stale bot comments do not keep telling contributors to fix already-resolved findings.
- Renames the visible score from "Quality score" to "Review readiness" and links the checked subject in the report.
- Adds repository dogfooding workflow for Maintainer Firewall itself.
- Clarifies that review readiness is advisory and not a judgment of contributor quality.
- Improves CODEOWNERS routing, JSON reports, AI safety controls, stale label cleanup, and configuration diagnostics.
- Groups Dependabot updates to reduce repository maintenance noise.
- Skips common automation authors by default and documents workflow concurrency to avoid duplicate report updates during rapid edits.
- Stabilizes skipped-event outputs and broadens default secret redaction for common token formats.
- Updates recommended workflows so skip labels and stale label cleanup react to label changes.

## 0.1.0 - Initial Release

- GitHub Action for issue and pull request review-readiness triage.
- Deterministic checks for missing context, reproduction details, environment details, linked issues, tests, large scope, sensitive paths, security-sensitive language, and possible exposed credentials.
- Optional OpenAI-assisted semantic analysis with repository guidance context, timeout handling, and pre-send redaction.
- Low-noise report comments, GitHub Actions step summaries, structured JSON report output, and workflow outputs.
- Label creation, stale label cleanup, CODEOWNERS routing hints, ignore rules, and dry-run support.
